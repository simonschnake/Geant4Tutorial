 The Virtual Geometry Model - Installation with CMT
====================================================
 
 Interfaces:
 -----------
  CMT is a powerfull configuration management tool. See http://www.cmtsite.org/ 
  for more ionformations

  CMT requires some interfaces files to configure Interface between VGM and others 
  packages. These packages are: Geant4, CLHEP, ROOT, AGDD and XERCESC.
  Besides these packages, you need also platform dependent configuration files 
  provided within package Platform.	      

  If you work on a project based on CMT, you have probably most of these
  interfaces files available with your project. Otherwise, you can use
  the files from the set provided with VGM in vgm/cmt/Interfaces.

  To let CMT know about the location of these files
  you have to set the environment variable CMTPATH.

  You now have to specify where are your ROOT, Geant4 and CLHEP directories :
    - open the Interface/ROOT/v****/cmt/requirements file and edit the 
      ROOT_home macro to match your installation
    - open the Interface/Geant4/v****/cmt/requirements file and edit the 
      Geant4_home macro to match your installation
    - open the Interface/CLHEP/v****/cmt/requirements file and edit the 
      CLHEP_home macro to match your installation

 Compilation:
 -----------
   cd vgm/cmt
   source $where_cmt_is_install/mgr/setup.sh   
   export CMTPATH="where_you_have_put_your_CLHEP_ROOT_GEANT4_InterfacesFiles"
   cmt config
   . setup.sh
   cmt make VGM

 Test:
 -----
   cd vgm/cmt
   cmt make tests
   
   For different test options, see vgm/test/README file;
   eg.
   vgm_test.exe VGM Geant4 Root noXML Solids

   For launching "test suite" files :
   ../test/test1_suite.sh  or
   ../test/test2_suite.sh
   The output from tests stored in log directory can be then compared
   with the reference output in vgm/test/log_ref directory.
 
 Examples:
 ---------
   cd vgm/cmt
   cmt make examples
