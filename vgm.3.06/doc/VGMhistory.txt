    Fixes:
      In Geant4GM:
      - Fixed debug output in MaterialFactory
      - Fix in importing a vacuum element with z < 1.0
        (important for the import of geometry from Root in Geant4).
      In Geant4GM. Root GM:
      - Fix in converting materials defined directly via Z, A
        (which caused break, reported by Filimon Roukoutakis)

    Tested with CLHEP 2.1.0.1, Root 5.28/00, Geant4 9.4;
    Linux: gcc 4.5.1 (FC14)
      
  30/04/2010
  version 3.03
    New features:
      New solids:
        Hype, Paraboloid
        DisplacedSolid
          implements G4DisplacedSolid and offset in TGeoBBox
        Ellipsoid:
          supported in Geant4 and GDML directly;
          in Root implemented as TGeoScaleShape with TGeoSphere,
          and the z-sides are cut via TGeoCompositeShape

      In BaseVGM:
      - New debug output for placements (in BaseVGM)

      In Geant4GM:
      - Adding an option to activate Geant4 geometry checking:
        Geant4GM::Factory::SetSurfCheck(bool)

      In RootGM: 
      - Added support for TGeoHalfSpace pseudo-shape;
        the shape is imported in VGM as a displaced big box solid.
      - In Placement:
        Added a check for nodes with overlaps and printing a warning
        if such node is processed, as overlaps are not allowed in Geant4
        geometry  
      - Added a prefix to composed assemblies names and its getter/setter
        (the default is &)
        
      Removed AgddGM, as its development was stopped.

      In test:
      - Adding TstGeometryViaGeant4::TestSpecial with commented code
        building external user detector construction 
      - Added as a possible case in ExtraSolid test.
      - Added stepping action to kill eventually looping tracks    

    Fixes:
      In Geant4GM:
       - In multiple placement - make solid type identical with mother 
         solid type (required by G4PVDivision)
       - In Arb8 - reordering vertices when necessary 
  
      In RootGM::
       - In Boolean solid - fixed cases when volume names include algebraic signs;
         take into account eventual offset shift of the constituent solids
       - In importing box solid with offset.
    
      Fixes in building systems, consolidated examples
    
    Tested with CLHEP 2.0.4.5, Root 5.27/02, Geant4 9.3.p01;

             In BaseVGM:
              - Fix in VPolyhedra::ConvertRadiusFactor: the angle DeltaPhi() has to be 
                converted from deg in rads. (This affected converting polyhedra solids
                from Geant4 to other geometries.)

              In XmlVGM: 
               In GDML exporter:
               - Implemented multiple placements, reflections
